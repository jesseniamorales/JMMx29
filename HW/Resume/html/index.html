            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>To pursue a career in UX/UI design in order to bring together my experiences with psychology, art and technology so that I can make an impact in the lives of others by improving their everyday experiences with the devices they use in their day to day life.
                I have a digital art background as well as a background in research from my undergraduate studies as a Psychology major. I have learned to combine my love for both design and research in this great field.
